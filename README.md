-  You can choose your Course by clicking Select button.
-  You'll get warning Toast notification while selecting same course multiple times. Toasts are displayed to provide feedback to users when they select a course, and they are informed if a course has already been selected or if they have    reached the credit hour limit.
-  You can see an overview of your course selections and your progress towards the credit hour limit.

<!-- How did I manage state -->
I managed state in my project using React `useState` hook. This allows me to declare and update variables to keep track of course data, user selections, remaining credit hours, and the total credit hours in the shopping cart, enabling real-time updates to the user interface.
